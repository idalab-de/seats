# Seats
For our new office, we treated the seat assignment as an integer programming problem. Now you can do the same by cloning this tiny repo.

## Steps

All you need to do is fill a google sheet with your seating preferences (we included the .xlsx version of ours in the repo), get an auth token for R's googlesheets library, and you are set!
